## ✨ Key Features

*   **🖥️ Centralized Web Interface:** Launch scans, configure parameters, and review results comfortably from a unified dashboard.
*   **⚙️ Background Tasks:** Asynchronous execution of heavy scanning processes without blocking the user experience.
*   **🧩 Modular Architecture:**
    *   🔍 **Subdomain Enumeration:** Exhaustive discovery of the target's attack surface.
    *   🛡️ **WAF Detection:** Identification of Web Application Firewalls.
    *   🚪 **Port Scanning:** Integration with Nmap to discover exposed services.
    *   🌐 **Web Server Analysis:** Live endpoint checking and technology fingerprinting using HTTPX.
    *   🕷️ **Endpoint Discovery:** Extraction of hidden routes and parameters (Katana integration).
    *   ☢️ **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated flaw hunting using Nuclei templates.
*   **🔔 Notification System:** Real-time alerts on new findings.
*   **🐳 100% Dockerized:** Fast, clean, and dependency-conflict-free deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.

## 🚀 Installation & Deployment

The fastest and recommended way to deploy the platform is using Docker.

### Prerequisites
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rootzro/bugbounty_reconv.git
   cd bugbounty_reconv
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   Edit the `.env` file in the root directory to set your secure credentials, API tokens (if used for subdomain enum), and database/messaging configurations.

3. **Spin up the services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Access the platform:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8000` (or your configured port). Log in using your credentials.

## 💻 Usage

1. **Login:** Access the web platform using your secure account.
2. **Dashboard:** Enter the target domain you want to audit.
3. **Settings:** Toggle the modules you wish to run (e.g., skip port scanning, use specific Nuclei templates, run WAF detection).
4. **Results:** Once the background task finishes, head over to the results tab. Data is neatly organized into folders (e.g., `recon_target.com_date/`) dividing the findings into:
   *   `/subdomains/`
   *   `/ports/`
   *   `/vulnerabilities/`
   *   `/endpoints/`
   *   `/waf/`
